# Live-Project-Snippets
These are changesets I implemented on a 2 week live project while at the Tech Academy. I participatd in 2 sprints in this time. The application is a review and coupon site where users can be buyers or sellers of products that are placed at high discounts.

My proudest changesets included creating a popup modal, and using a ViewModel with KnockoutJS, was able to show a live preview of how a sellers product would be formatted on our site. I was also able to configure this into a Partial, so that all pages could grab the partial, and import the data as it was being written.

For legal purposes, these snippets are all I am allowed to host.

# Here is an example of the [Razor syntax with Knockout](https://github.com/ChrisConnell1/Live-Project-Snippets/blob/master/Knockout/Binds.cs)

# And [here](https://github.com/ChrisConnell1/Live-Project-Snippets/blob/master/Knockout/Script.js) is the actual Knockout script applied.
